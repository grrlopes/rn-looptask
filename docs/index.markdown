Welcome to [looptask app]. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our mobile application, including any data related to camera access.

**Camera Access**

Our app requests permission to access your deviceâ€™s camera. We use this permission to access your camera in order to scan QR codes.

**4. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

- **Third Parties:** We do not share camera data with third parties. Any data collected is used strictly within the app for its intended purpose.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a subpoena).

**5. Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your camera data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**6. Your Choices**

- **Permission Settings:** You can control the camera permission settings on your device. You may choose to deny access, though this may affect the functionality of certain features in our app.
